      What is PCB2MBBS?
      -----------------

      PCB2MBBS is a program which will convert PCBoard style file
      listings to Mystic BBS.  This is useful for importing CD-ROMs
      into Mystic BBS, since most CD-ROMs that are BBS ready include
      at least PCBoard file listings.  It may also be useful for
      automatically importing files on a file network if your software
      can maintain a PCBoard-type file listing.

      Using PCB2MBBS
      --------------

      Usage PCB2MBBS is fairly easy, but sometimes time consuming if you
      are importing an entire CD-ROM with many directories.  The command
      line parameters are as follows:

         PCB2MBBS: <PCBoard Name>  <Mystic BBS Name>  <-DUPE>

         <-DUPE> is the command line option to turn on duplicate file
         searching.  This is needed if you have a 3rd party program keeping
         a list of files in PCBoard format, and you only need to import
         files which aren't yet added into Mystic.  PCB2MBBS will search
         each file in the file listing to see if it already exists in your
         Mystic file base.

         <PCBoard Name> is the full path and filename of the PCBoard file
         listing to convert to Mystic BBS format.

         <Mystic BBS Name> is the full path and filename of the Mystic BBS
         file which will be created.  The file extention does not need to
         be supplied, since PCB2MBBS will just strip it.  Two files are
         outputted for each file directory converted:

              <FileName>.DIR : Holds the file information for this base.
              <FileName>.DES : Holds the file descriptions for this base.

         These files either need to be created in the DATA directory, or
         copied to the data directory after created.

         An example of running PCB2MBBS.EXE if the PCBoard files list was
         "D:\BBSDESC\DIR1.LST" and the path to the Mystic BBS data directory
         was "C:\MYSTIC\DATA\" :

         PCB2MBBS.EXE D:\BBSDESC\DIR1.LST C:\MYSTIC\DATA\DIR1

         The above command line parameter will convert the PCBoard file list
         located in "D:\BBSDESC\DIR1.LST" into the Mystic BBS data directory
         under the filename "DIR1".

         After a file base has been converted, you need to go into the
         Mystic BBS file base editor and add the file base to go along with
         the data files that you've just converted.  The "FileName" field
         of this added file base should be "DIR1" since that was the filename
         that you told PCB2MBBS to use.  The following is a screen capture
         of the File Base Editor.  Option [B] should now be changed to "DIR1"
         Option [H] should be changed to the path on the CD-ROM which stores
         the files which you've just imported.  

              File Base 1 of 1

              A. Name           : Directory 1 of CD-ROM
              B. Filename       : DIR1
              C. Display File   :
              D. ACS            : s20
              E. List ACS       : s20
              F. Upload ACS     : s255
              G. Download ACS   : s20
              H. Storage Path   : D:\DIR1\
              I. Password       :
              J. Show Uploader  : Yes
              K. Default NewScan: Yes
