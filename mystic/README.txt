This archive contains the source code for Mystic BBS software.

Mystic BBS is Copyright 1997-Current year by James Coyle.

Mystic BBS is currently compiled exclusively using Free Pascal
compiler (www.freepascal.org) the current release being 2.4.4.

Mystic BBS is released under GPL Version 3 licensing which is
included in the archive.  An information header is prefixed on

The author can be contacted at this time through e-mail at mysticbbs@gmail.com.  It is
encouraged that fixes and additions be coordinated with the current authors.

The current code here reflects the latest 1.10 alphas and is not yet compatible with 1.09 or
previous 1.10 alphas.

With the 1.10 final/stable release we will be officially annoucing Mystic as a GPL program and
at that time we will branch off to a current stable and development code base.  In the
meantime we are using the end of this development cycle to get the project integrated with
SourceForge.
