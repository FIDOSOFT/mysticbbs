!!! WARNING!!!

The current code here reflects the latest 1.10 alphas and is not yet compatible with 1.09.

With the 1.10 final/stable release we will be officially annoucing Mystic as a GPL program and
at that time we will branch off to a current stable and development code base as well as release
an upgrade package to get everyone on the same page with both binary and source distributions.

If you are not running at least 1.10 Alpha 15 than this code will not run for you.
